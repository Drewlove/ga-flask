# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Python: Web Development

## Overview
Objective of this lesson is to cover all the qualitative subjects/ideas the underpin why and how we use Python development in making web applications. The lesson covers the client-server relationship, so students understand how web devlopment works and how web pages render. It then moves into talking about how Python is used to build out websites (touching on backend like Djangoa and Flask), and then uses those topics to transition into explaining web apps and web frameworks. 

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Review Python they have learned over past x3 days
- Learn how Python is used in web development
- Understand what web apps and web frameworks are and how and why developers use them


## Duration
60 minutes.

## Frontend vs Backend  + Client/Server Intro (45 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- goal is for students to understand client/server relationship for when they have to declare call types in routing later on. 
- also for frontend/backend to be discussed, so that they understand why python is necessary for the web dev they are going to be doing. 

#### Talking Points:
- Review what web development is, and use this as intro to frontend vs backend.
- Explain what frontend is, and use real world example, but don't demo yet (i.e. talk about facebook and how the the colors + newsfeed is organized by html)
- Explain what backend is (example of logging in to website and how the website validates)
- Transition to talking about client/server relationship - this is the way that the frontend "talks" to the backend
- Our computers make an ask of the server, and then the server sends back a response - we are going to learn how to make those "asks" with Python + HTML, and then also how to write programs that guide the "responses" with Python.
- watch video on client server relationship
- Do a walk through of New York Public Library Website and breakdown what is frontend/styled, and what is pulled from the backend (images, loging in, links, etc.)
- review frontend v backend and client v server
- explain post v get --> do more explaining during routes in Flask lesson, but for now tie to client/server relationship
- Explain HTTP and why HTTP is an important idea to know
- Work through types of things POST requests can do: sends parameters in body of page to server, makes updates to server
- Work through types of things GET requests can do: sends parameters via url to server, not changes made to server

## Python for Web Development (5 mins)

#### Teaching Tips:
- goal is for students to understand the why of python for web development 
- want to teach them high level of what makes python great and often used for web dev, to then transition into next hour

#### Talking Points:
- Start with high level overview:
1. Python great because libraries exists to do SO MUCH. Most languages you have to pick wether you are going to focus more on data relationship, or more on views and interaction - Python has libraries that make it easy to do both. 
2. Python frameworks make it easy to launcha website at very low cost. 
- Before we get into definition of libraries and frameworks, lets talk about how this relates to client/server + post/get we just learned about
- close out section, and then libraries and frameworks explained in next section
