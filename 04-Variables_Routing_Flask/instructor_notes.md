Kevin Coyle
---

## Overview
This lesson teaches students about variables and routing, two important concepts to grasp before students learn to render templates, and create their own APIs

---
## Important Notes or Prerequisites
Before this lesson, it's imperative that students understand assigning variables in Python. 
Students should also be versed in functions, and have an understanding (hello-world level) of launching a Flask app.


## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
1. Create a variable/value in Flask app and display the value on a webpage
2. Read in a variable/value from outside of Flask app
3. Create a route in Flask
----

## Duration
60 minutes.

## Suggested Agenda
<!--- Provide a breakdown of what will happen in this lesson. --->

| Time | Activity | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00 - 0:02 | Welcome | Introduce the lessonâ€™s objectives and agenda.|
| 0:02 - 0:22 | Part I: Variables | To get an understanding of variables in the context of a Flask app |
| 0:23 - 0:31 | Activity on creating variables | To get students writing a flask app |
| 0:21 - 0:40 | Part II Routing in Flask| To go over what routes are|
| 0:41 - 0:55 | Activity Creating Routes | To get an understanding of how to create a route?|
| 0:55 - 0:60  | Summary | Wrap up the learning and share next steps.|

## Materials and Preparation
- Prior to this lesson, student should have a code editor, as well as Flask installed

## Differentiation and Extensions
- More advanced students might try reading in a Pandas dataframe from the previous day and outputting some data.
- Students having a more difficult time with this might want to revisit the lecture on functions, and variables

---

## Lesson Procedure


### Part I: Variables  (23 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- This part of the lesson should reinforce thoughts on variable assignment in Python

---

###  Activity on creating variables (10 minutes)

#### Talking Points:
- Reading in a file from another Python file is more pythonic, and ultimately, less code

---

###  Activity Creating Routes (30 minutes)

#### Talking Points:
- This is how we will set up APIs later
- It's incredibly important to udnerstand these base level concepts first though

---

###  Part II Part II Routing in Flask (10 minutes)

#### Talking Points:
- This is how we will set up APIs later
- It's incredibly important to udnerstand these base level concepts first though

---

### Part II activity

#### Talking Points:
- This is how you create an API for another developer to use, or someone else that doesn't write in gluten free bed
