### Activity: Review Flask App & Intro to HTML (xx minutes)

#### Lecture + Discussion: Why HTML?
#### Slide 1 ("What does this look like") - Slide 4 ("Adding this into our App")
> Before we get into what HTML is, let's look at why we use it
> Review codepen without HTML: https://codepen.io/thisisdrewlove/pen/MXLgqW
> Review codepen with Tags: https://codepen.io/thisisdrewlove/pen/rKPNPY?editors=1000
> Discussion: Why do you think developers use HTML?

> **Teaching Tips:**
> - HTML allows developers to create content, structure, and presentation

####  Lecture + We Do: Creating an HTML document
#### (Slides XX (("Name of Slide") - Slides XX ("Name of Slide"))
> Set up of HTML document
> Explain key components of HTML document: <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>, <head>, <meta charset="utf-8">, <title></title>, <body>
> Students create index.html file and set up HTML doctype

> **Teaching Tips:**
>

### Activity: HTML Basics (xx minutes)

#### Lecture: Anatomy of a Tag
#### Slide XX ("NAME OF SLIDE") - Slide XX ("NAME OF SLIDE")
> The basic building blocks of an HTML document are elements
> Elements consist of an opening tag, content, and closing tag
> The tag tells the web browser how to render, or display, the content

> **Teaching Tips:**
> The tag defines how the element is rendered and how it functions
> The element is the whole "chunk" of text that includes the tag, content and closing tag

####  Lecture + We Do:  Creating a Profile
#### (Slides XX (("Name of Slide") - Slides XX ("Name of Slide"))
> Show basic tags: https://codepen.io/thisisdrewlove/pen/rKPBbe
> Have students create their profile:
> Ask students to create their basic profile in the index.html files
> Name, About Me, Experience, Hobbies
> show h1, h2, b, p

> **Teaching Tips:**
> Most common mistake is not closing a tag
> Could be helpful to ask students what mistakes they made and learned from
while creating their profile

### Activity:  HTML Attributes(xx minutes)

#### Lecture + We Do: HTML Attributes
#### Slide XX ("NAME OF SLIDE") - Slide XX ("NAME OF SLIDE")
> Building on our knowledge of tags, let's start to explore the next topic: HTML Attributes
> An HTML attribute provides extra information to the browser about the tag
> Some tags require attributes in order to work properly
> One tag that requires the attribute, is the <img src="image.com"/>
> https://codepen.io/thisisdrewlove/pen/OEdJwL?editors=1000


#### Lecture + You Do: Add an image to your profile
#### Slide XX ("NAME OF SLIDE") - Slide XX ("NAME OF SLIDE")
> Ask students to add a picture to their profile

> **Teaching Tips:**
> - Students can probably find their own pictures using their facebook accounts (emphasize
do not get distracted with facebook, just get a picture and get out)
> - Student are likely to forget opening and|or closing quotes on the src attribute

### Activity:  Intro to CSS (xx minutes)

#### Lecture + We Do: Intro to CSS
#### Slide XX ("NAME OF SLIDE") - Slide XX ("NAME OF SLIDE")
> HTML tells browsers what content to display, and CSS tells browsers how that content should look. CSS > > CSS consists of layout, spacing, colors, fonts, and much more, to make your website look fantastic.
> CSS Basics: Cascading Style Sheets, because because they are pages - or sheets - used to adjust the presentation — or style — of a website.
> Harry Potter: Tags w|Pic and CSS: https://codepen.io/thisisdrewlove/pen/mKvdYN?editors=1100
> The word "cascading" describes the hierarchical way that styles are implemented through CSS, we'll get to that later
> Create a css file
>

> **Teaching Tips:**
> -

####  Lecture + You Do: Selectors
#### (Slides XX (("Name of Slide") - Slides XX ("Name of Slide"))
> Introduce Selectors
> Refer to Harry Potter codepen, review <body> and <a> tag
> Selectors specify what elements are being styled
> Experiment with changing background-color, color, and font-size
> try using different selectors to change the color of different elements

> **Teaching Tips:**
> - Teaching tip 1
> - Teaching tip 2
> - Teaching tip 3
