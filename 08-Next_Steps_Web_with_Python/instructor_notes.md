## Overview
This lesson goes over some next steps to take on the path of web development in Python, especially as it relates to flask.

## Important Notes or Prerequisites
This assumes that students have learned teh web framework Flask sufficiently and are looking for next steps to take.


## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
1. Identify common web concepts to dive into next
2. Identify common Python libraries used for front-end web development
3. Identify common Python based back-end web development tech stacks


## Duration
45 minutes.

## Lesson Procedure

### Extending Flask (6 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- This is a general idea of where to go next with Flask.
- You can incorporate any of your own experience here as well.

#### Talking Points:
- The onus of creativity is on the designer. 
- However, many ideas of extensions of Flask have already been built!
- Check documentationion to make sure you aren't recoding the wheel. 


### Front-End Libraries (8 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- Students might have questions about other languages at this stage
- Those are beyond the scope of this lesson


### Back-end Libraries and DBs (8 minutes)

#### Talking Points:
- Explain that a database is just an extension on the patterns we learned in previous lessons.


### Other Web Frameworks in Python (8 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- Many students who are a bit familiar with Python might have heard of Django. 
- Encourage them to get a solid understanding of Flask before moving to Django


### Web Dev in General (8 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- Basic HTML is a great first place to go, regardless of scripting language.
