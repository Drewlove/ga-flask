## Overview
This lesson teaches how to use templates in Flask. It walks through what templates are, as well as a common use case for templates in web development.
---

## Important Notes and Prerequisites
Students should already know how to launch a basic Flask app, as well as what variables are. Students are expected to have Flask 0.12 or later installed.

---
## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
1. Explain what Jinja2 and why it's useful.
2. Successfully explain what a template design pattern in Flask does. 
3. Create a template HTML document and pass variables into it via a Flask app.

## Duration
30 minutes.

## Suggested Agenda
<!--- Provide a breakdown of what will happen in this lesson. --->

| Time | Activity | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00 - 0:05 | Welcome | Introduce the lessonâ€™s objectives and agenda.|
| 0:05 - 0:10 | What are Jinja Templates | High level discussion on templates|
| 0:10 - 0:15 | Re-Creating the "Hello, World" Flask app | To review our pattern before we expand on it|
| 0:15 - 0:25 | Extending the "Hello, World" Flask app to include a template | Explains templating with a code along|
| 0:25 - 0:30 | Summary | Wrap up the learning and share next steps.|

## Materials and Preparation
- Students should have Python 3, a text editor like Sublime or Atom, a web browser, and Flask installed
- Instructors will need the above.

---
## Differentiation and Extensions
- For more advanced students: try adding in for loop logic into template brackets
- For more advanced students: ask them to stylize their html files
- For struggling students: a review on variable assignment and Flask first principles is necessary.

## Lesson Procedure

### Welcome (5 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- This lesson builds on our hello world app from earlier.
- This is a great moment to answer any questions about routes/variables that are outstanding.
- Students will need to firmly understand these concepts in order to apply templates well.

---
### What are Jinja Templates (5 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- Jinja2 is the template engine that Flask uses. 
- It's not absolutely crucial that students understand how Jinja2 works
- It is necessary though to give them an understanding of what Jinja and what templates are

---
### Re-Creating the "Hello, World" Flask app (5 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- There should be sufficient time in this section to answer/clear up outstanding questions regarding the hello world app
- Students should also be familiar with how to start a server with Flask at this point, but this is included in the lesson to drive home concepts. 
---

### Extending the "Hello, World" Flask app to include a template (10 minutes)

#### Teaching Tips:
- Here we are passing variables into templates. However, there are extensions of this pattern:
 - Passing in if/else logic, 
 - Passing in for loops
 - And so on
